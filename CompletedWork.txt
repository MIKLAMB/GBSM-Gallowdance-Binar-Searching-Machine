1.Defined the data structure for the input data that will be searching, included the size of the data and any necessary padding or alignment requirements.

2.Loaded the input data into memory and prepared it for searching.

3.Initialized the SHA-512 hashing algorithm by loading by initial hash values and setted up the message schedule.

4.Process the input data in chunks using the SHA-512 compression function. Each chunk should be padded and aligned according to the SHA-512 specification.

5.After processing all of the input data, finalized the SHA-512 algorithm by added all necessary paddings and appendings the length of the input data.

6.Stored the resulting hash value in memory for later comparison during the search.

7.Implemented the search algorithm, which should read the input data and compared it against the target hash value. usied a variety of algorithms, such as linear search.

8.Improved performance, considered using parallelization techniques such as multi-threading or vectorization to speed up the search algorithm.

9.Implemented the decryption algorithm, which should take the encrypted input data and use the SHA-512 algorithm in reverse to recover the original plaintext data.
